# CS411 Project Assignment 1

<ins>Proposal: </ins><br /><br />
Our project will allow users to create and organize travel itineraries, specify details of their trip
(ex. arrival time, duration of the trip, interests in attractions and restaurants, location of hotels, etc.),
and attach relevant information/links/screenshots to their itineraries, such as a hotel booking reservation
or the contact information of a tour guide, for easy access. We will use databases with information about weather, 
events, and attractions in the area the user is traveling to improve suggestions. According to personal preference 
and their location, our software will select several tourist spots and restaurants and then, using Google Maps, 
calculate the most efficient route between the locations. The APIs for Yelp, Facebook, and Twitter will be used 
for third-party authentication in the app, which will provide users with detailed information and comments about 
the destination that is recommended based on interests fetched from the user’s data. On top of these features, 
we will also integrate ChatGPT’s API into the app to allow the user to generate a new itinerary for a specified 
location or simply ask for recommendations on what to do in that location, then either save the generated response 
or discard it.
