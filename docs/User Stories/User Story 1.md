As a new solo traveler, I want to get completely new and fully fleshed-out ideas for itineraries in places I've never been/heard of and customize them to my liking after seeing the generated itineraies so that I don't have to spend countless hours trying to find the "best" itinerary for me. I would also like to be able to save and use these itineraries if I wish to.

This scenario is titled the "Generate Itinerary" scenario. The user will first navigate to the login page of the app (login story) and be authenticated. The user will then be able to, on the home page, press a button entitled "Generate a Trip for Me" where they will be prompted to enter into a search bar the place they would like to visit with a prompt at the top titled "Where would you like to go?" After entering in the city/country they would like to visit, they will then be prompted with another question/search bar entitled "When would you like to visit?" where there will be multiple options: to enter in a specific date, to select a general season, or a "Not sure" button. After selecting one of these options, our ChatGPT API backed itinerary generator will take the information and display the generated general itinerary based on the details they input. If the user wishes to further customize their trip, edit, save, or quit there will be four options at the bottom of their screen as well as an "x" button at the top left corner of the screen; the four options will be either a search bar to enter in a specific response that the usere wishes to generate and does not fit any of the other button prompts
