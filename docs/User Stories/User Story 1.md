As a new solo traveler, I want to get completely new and fully fleshed-out ideas for itineraries in places I've never been/heard of and customize them to my liking after seeing the generated itineraies so that I don't have to spend countless hours trying to find the "best" itinerary for me. I would also like to be able to save and use these itineraries if I wish to.
