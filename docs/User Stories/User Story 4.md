# User Story #4

<ins>Story: </ins><br /><br />
As a passenger, I want to be able to plan out my whole trip for each day and link some locations and reserved events that are purchased ahead.


<ins>Description: </ins><br /><br />
For a logged-in user, if he/she has some must-see attractions or already got a reservation for a certain event, they should be able to add those classified activities to their itinerary before generating the plans. After users access the home page and enter the exact date and destination, press the button “I have somewhere must to go”, then there will pop up a new page for users to specify their already planned itineraries. On that page, there is a space for users to type the address where events will take place. After presetting the location, for events that occur at a specific time slot, users should be able to choose the exact time slot on that page. For easy access and direct check, users can attach reservation links or emails to their activities which can be easily pulled up and they can also add contact information. After the exact itinerary has been generated through our App, users can check detailed information through third-party authentication, thus it is convenient for users to decide whether save the itinerary or make some specific changes. By clicking the place that has been generated in the itinerary, it will jump to the Facebook/Twitter official page of that place, therefore users can check other tourists’ comments and make final decisions.
