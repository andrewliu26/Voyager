# cs411-project
Our project is designed to make customized traveling plans for clients who are using our software. 
Climate information, current event information, and tourist attractions will be thought of as ideal datasets to use for API. 
We will also ask the client to choose their arrival time, how long will they stay, their interests in attractions and restaurants, and also the location of hotels. 
According to personal preference and their location, our software will select several tourist spots and restaurants, and then calculate the distance between these destinations 
by using Google Map, and then come up with the most efficient tourist route for the client. 
Yelp and Facebook can be thought of as the third-party authentication that is used in the project, by using those, our clients can check the detailed information and comments 
of the destination that our program recommends.
